    <h1>Zahra Traboulsi</h1>
    <p>
      I'm an experienced software engineer and life-long Londoner with a dry and
      self-deprecating sense of humour to match. At the moment, I work on the
      Terraform Registry and Terraform Cloud at HashiCorp.
    </p>

    <p>
      My past roles have included working on UI infrastructure for lab
      automation tools at Synthace, a React Native application for increasing
      transparency in the diamond industry at GemFair and an iOS app that
      displays text, graphs and images at Bloomberg.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of the day job, I still think way too much about the day job. If I'm not, this might be because I'm drawing, painting and
      cooking. Otherwise, you might find me thinking about design, drafting an essay or drinking yet another latte.
